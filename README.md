## Details
This essentially a Sporcle quiz copy. I couldn't find a non-landmine version of this quiz... so I made it myself! You are given a pokemon on the bottom left corner in text. Choose the correct pokemon and you are awarded a point. If you don't get it right, too bad! The game moves onto the next pokemon. The game ends once you've gone through all pokemon in that generation. 

I was originally going to export this to Greenfoot (hence why I used Greenfoot language), but the file turned out to be too large for the platforms ~20MB limit, so I was forced to upload it here instead! The original project consisted of just a flat image I found off Google with all generation 1 pokemon. Simply put: it was terrible. I later found a compressed zip containing ALL 1000+ pokemon (what a lifesaver!) which I then used in my project.

All Pokemon image credits go to Nintendo/Game Freak.
