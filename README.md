# Click That Pokemon!
## Download Instructions
IMPORTANT: You NEED to have downloaded Greenfoot for this!
1. Go to https://www.greenfoot.org/download and install Greenfoot for your platform (if you don't already have Greenfoot).
2. Download the .zip file above.
    - (How do I do this?) Click on the .zip file. There should be a small download button on the top right next to the "Raw" button.
4. Follow this link to download the zipped image files: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_7IOrdbb1V-X8ZDigzh_pJr-SAogwNyy/view?usp=sharing
5. Unzip ClickThatPokemon.zip once it's finished downloading.
6. Move the images.zip into the ClickThatPokemon folder, then unzip it (images.zip).
    - Depending on how your device unzips this, you might get a nested file situation (ie: ClickThatPokemon/images/images/[all the images]
    - If this happens, you MUST move all the images to the top most images foler (ie: directory should look like ClickThatPokemon/images[all the images]
8. Open Greenfoot.
9. At the top, press Scenario -> Open. Locate the ClickThatPokemon folder you just downloaded and modifed. Open/Select that folder.
10. Let the scenario configure. This may take a while.
11. Once it's finished configuring, hit "Run" at the bottom to start the game. 
12. Enjoy!

Note: If the overall game in Greenfoot looks small to you: its like that. I made this on my laptop (with a very small screen) so that's being reflected in the Greenfoot project! Since Greenfoot is old and decrepid, you can't zoom! Enjoy my 1000 by 600 game because my laptop is small and Greenfoot doesn't allow zooming. 

## Details
This essentially a Sporcle quiz copy. I couldn't find a non-landmine version of this quiz... so I made it myself! You are given a pokemon on the bottom left corner in text. Choose the correct pokemon and you are awarded a point. If you don't get it right, too bad! The game moves onto the next pokemon. The game ends once you've gone through all pokemon in that generation. 

I was originally going to export this to Greenfoot (hence why I used Greenfoot language), but the file turned out to be too large for the platforms ~20MB limit, so I was forced to upload it here instead! The original project consisted of just a flat image I found off Google with all generation 1 pokemon. Simply put: it was terrible. I later found a compressed zip containing ALL 1000+ pokemon (what a lifesaver!) which I then used in my project.

All Pokemon image credits go to Nintendo/Game Freak.

## Updates/Patch Notes:
This file got even bigger than it was before. I was no longer able to simply just upload the .gfar file anymore (4.2 GB, yikes). Instead everyone now has to follow a slightly more complicated 10 step program (sorry). 

Version 2.0:
- Included a "results" button on the game over screen to display results of your quiz.
- Updated generation selection page to include all the same art style (earlier image was just a bunch of images I found off Google. I'm now using the proper sprites I got from that mega zip).
- Fixed a few minor bugs.
- Code documentation.
