## Download Instructions
IMPORTANT: You NEED to have downloaded Greenfoot for this!
1. Go to https://www.greenfoot.org/download and install Greenfoot for your platform (if you don't already have Greenfoot).
2. Download the .gfar file above.
    - (How do I do this?) Click on the .gfar file. There should be a small download button for it on the top right next to the "Raw" button.
4. Open the file and let the scenario configure. This may take a while.
5. Once it's finished configuring, hit "Run" at the bottom to start the game. 
6. Enjoy!

Option 2: Just play on it Greenfoot!

Note: If the overall game in Greenfoot looks small to you: its like that. I made this on my laptop (with a very small screen) so that's being reflected in the Greenfoot project! Since Greenfoot is old and decrepid, you can't zoom! Enjoy my 1000 by 600 game because my laptop is small and Greenfoot doesn't allow zooming. 

## Details
This essentially a Sporcle quiz copy. I couldn't find a non-landmine version of this quiz... so I made it myself! You are given a pokemon on the bottom left corner in text. Choose the correct pokemon and you are awarded a point. If you don't get it right, too bad! The game moves onto the next pokemon. The game ends once you've gone through all pokemon in that generation. 

I was originally going to export this to Greenfoot (hence why I used Greenfoot language), but the file turned out to be too large for the platforms ~20MB limit, so I was forced to upload it here instead! The original project consisted of just a flat image I found off Google with all generation 1 pokemon. Simply put: it was terrible. I later found a compressed zip containing ALL 1000+ pokemon (what a lifesaver!) which I then used in my project.

All Pokemon image credits go to Nintendo/Game Freak.

## Updates/Patch Notes:
The .gfar file is back now! Game is now much, much more optimized.

Version 2.0:
- Included a "results" button on the game over screen to display results of your quiz.
- Updated generation selection page to include all the same art style (earlier image was just a bunch of images I found off Google. I'm now using the proper sprites I got from that mega zip).
  - Everything is now a JPEG! (except custom cursor because I need that transparent background).
- Fixed a few minor bugs.

Version 3.0:
- Now using sprite pages instead of individual pokemon images. (Greenfoot supports me again! :)
